ChinaVis Data Challenge â€“ Brief Introduction
Data Challenge is one of the most important parts of ChinaVis. It provides a set of scenarios, fruitful data and concrete challenging problems to researchers, developers and amateurs who use their most effective visual analytics techniques and tools to complete visual analytics tasks. Data Challenge is designed to help participants better evaluate the effectiveness of their techniques and tools in solving complex problems. In the same time, we would like to advance the development of the field of visualization and visual analytics in China.

In this competition, we joined in the challenge 1.
Content of challenge1:
"CICSC (China Intelligence Cyber Security Conference) (fiction) is a national academic conference in the field of intelligence cyber security, which aims to enhance communication and cooperation among academia, business, and society, and promote the development of innovation in this field. The conference is a three-day conference, including academic seminars, results exhibition, and hacking competition, with six major themes: data security, IoT security, mobile security, privacy protection, smart venues, and smart security technology innovation. During the conference, there are a number of senior experts and business gurus to bring wonderful keynote reports, experience sharing and results display, and also invited many exhibitors and media reporters. The scale of participants in this conference is around 5000 people.

In order to strengthen the management of the venue and echo the theme of "Smart Venue Safety Operation", wireless sensor technology was used to obtain the real-time location information of the participants. Participants are required to wear an electronic badge with a built-in signal transmitter and personal information when entering the venue. The wireless sensors arranged in the venue can receive and record the signals from the signal transmitters within its coverage area in real time. The collected sensor data can be used to detect the distribution of the crowd in real time, which facilitates the venue management to mobilize resources in a timely and reasonable manner, handle various emergency situations, and escort the smooth progress of the conference issues. The conference organizing committee has set up a temporary data analysis team to analyze the sensor data, assist the organizing committee in managing the venue, and respond to and handle various emergency situations. Assuming that you are a member of the data analysis team, please design and implement a data visual analysis solution to complete the data analysis task assigned by the organizing committee."
